/**
 * A tiny FIFO counting semaphore for bounding concurrent agent runs.
 *
 * A turn is no longer a `claude` child process, but it is still expensive: the
 * agent loop holds a sandbox and spawns real build/test commands in it. Without
 * a cap, N concurrent Slack threads run N loops and can OOM the container.
 * Turns acquire a slot before running and release it when done (or aborted);
 * excess turns queue in arrival order. Cap via MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS
 * (cruise-line's MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS analog; default 3).
