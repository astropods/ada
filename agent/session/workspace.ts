 * Per-session sandbox workspace.

 * The Claude child inherits the Node process CWD, which in the container is
 * `/app` (Dockerfile WORKDIR) — the read-only source tree. Every run would
 * otherwise share it and be unable to write. Instead we give each run its own
 * writable directory (containing its repo checkout, see repo.ts) and pass it as
 * the SDK `cwd`.
 *
 * Set WORKSPACE_ROOT to a persistent volume in production (a Slack thread may
 * resume days later); it defaults to `tmpdir()` for local dev. Stale workspaces
 * are reclaimed by a TTL sweep (startWorkspaceGc) so per-thread clones don't fill
 * the disk — the analog of cruise-line's `/cleanup`.

 * Workspaces are directories (`mkdtempSync`), but WORKSPACE_ROOT is shared: the
 * local SQLite conversation database lives there too, and it is a FILE that also
 * begins with `ada-` — `ada-flue.db`, plus its `-wal`/`-shm`/`-journal`
 * siblings. The prefix test alone matched every one of them, so a deployment
 * idle for longer than maxAgeMs reclaimed its own conversation history: exactly
 * the durability the persistence layer exists to provide, deleted by another
 * module's housekeeping. (db.ts now also keeps the database out of this
 * namespace; either fix alone closes the hole, and they are independent on
 * purpose.)
 *
 * `root` is injectable for the same reason `now` is: ROOT is bound at module
 * load from WORKSPACE_ROOT, so a test cannot reach it by setting the variable.
