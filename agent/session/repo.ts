/**
 * Per-thread repo checkout.
 *
 * A conversation (Slack thread / web session) is one task on one repo. The user
 * binds it with `work on <owner/repo>`; we clone that repo once into the thread's
 * workspace and reuse it across turns. This is the read-WRITE analog of
 * cruise-line's per-PR clone dirs: cruise-line shares a read-only clone and
 * `git clean`s between runs, but Ada edits/commits, so every thread gets its own
 * isolated checkout that is NOT reset between turns (work-in-progress is kept).
 *
 * Auth uses the image's git credential helper (`gh auth git-credential`) fed by
 * GH_TOKEN, so the token is never written into `.git/config` (unlike embedding it
 * in the clone URL). Private repos require the user to have connected GitHub and
 * installed the App on the repo.
